    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>My interest in computing originated from the impact of programming and scripting for video games, I thrive on the ability to make meaningful change and practical solutions.</p>
    <p>In university I studied many core computer science principles; real-time rendering fuelled my passion for the power of automated tasks and pipeline development. I always feel a sense of accomplishment from designing and implementing reusable coding solutions with long-term usability at the forefront of its design.</p>
    <p>In the following years I expanded my technical capabilities in Java, Spring, SQL and Javascript, holding data security and code performance at the forefront of design considerations.</p>

        <p>Although I find myself delving between study and video games, I love to develop custom content for my favourite games. I’m always delving into new software and exploring its capabilities up to/beyond the obvious limits; I particularly enjoying the practices of digital art and breakdowns of visual design.</p>
        <p>For the past two years I’ve hosted an online Dungeons and Dragons campaign where I get the opportunity to plan, organise and present up to and exceeding 4 hours’ worth of content each fortnight. I have to be adaptable around unplanned/unanticipated events; memorising story details, rules and assets.</p>
        <p>I offset stresses by playing my bass guitar and partake in 10km walks on the weekend whenever possible.</p>
