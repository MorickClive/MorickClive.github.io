        <h2>Full-Stack Application: Project Vale</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>After 2021 I had to leave my role in QA Ltd due to health and family reasons.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until 2022 that I had an opportunity to focus back on coding and knew that I would need to revisit programming, adding it to my day-to-day routine; I decided to create a repository that would outline the skills I would refresh, covering existing topics as well as some new skills such as React.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>About:</h4>
        <p>As part of my refresh, I wanted to cover full-stack development techniques I've used in the past; there are many technologies to keep track of and can fall out of memory; this can be a real problem as part of my portfolio could deteriorate without maintenance.</p>
        <h4>Existing Skills:</h4>
        <ul><li>Git and SVN</li>
            <li>Agile & issue tracking</li>
            <li>Java 8 & Maven Build</li>
            <li>Junit & Mockito</li>
            <li>JDBC</li>
            <li>Spring API</li>
            <li>Node.js & Javascript</li>
            <li>Cucumber & Gherkin</li>
            <li>Git and SVN</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I was curious about expanding my front-end knowledge, so this project provided the opportunity to look into React and how it differs from the AngularJS training that QA Ltd provided me; this was partly due to an exploration of Angular9 and wishing to balance the benefits and drawbacks of each framework. A big part of this is that Angular had evolved in my time whilst working with a client on primarily back-end oriented technologies, so I had an opportunity to review how these technologies have changed since.</p>

            <p>The name "Vale" came from raids instances in Guild Wars 2; it was an arbitrary naming convention that could act as nomenclature for potential projects, becoming a set of significant repositories on my GitHub.<br /><br />The raid instances are titled as follows:</p>
            <ul><li>Spirit [Vale]</li>
                <li>Salvation [Pass]</li>
                <li>[Stronghold] of the Faithful</li>
                <li>[Bastion] of the Penitent</li>
                <li>[Hall] of Chains</li>
                <li>[Mythwright] Gambit</li>
                <li>The Key of [Ahdashim]</li>
