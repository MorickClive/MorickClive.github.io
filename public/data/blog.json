I've pushed SCSS data into unique pages and imported them centrally; this should keep page-specific CSS maintainable by keeping page-specific styles contained.</p><p>Additionally, I've encountered the \"aspect-ratio\" property; it's pretty helpful in overcoming a bug I had with the avatar picture on the [About] page; now it scales with the available resolution, and I'm hoping to refine the responsive nature of the site as development progresses.</p>"
